Base / Farcaster Mini App Creation Workflow
1️⃣ Define the App Idea
Decide the app name
Define the purpose / function
Know what problem the app solves
(Example: NaijaWhot game, engagement tracker, etc.)
2️⃣ Generate the App with an AI Builder
Use an AI app builder like:
lovable.app
v0.app
Process
Enter your app design prompt
Refine the UI and behavior
Test until the output matches your vision
Publish the app to get a live URL
👉 example: myapp.lovable.app
This link becomes your app’s main site.
3️⃣ Connect GitHub & Manage Project Files
Connect your AI builder to GitHub
Push generated project files to your repo
Add required assets:
App icon
Preview image / screenshot
Create or edit the manifest file: 👉 farcaster.json
This file is what Base uses to link your app to your account.
4️⃣ Prepare App Assets
You need:
App icon
App preview image
Screenshot of the working app
Use an AI Asset Generator to:
Resize images to required dimensions
Optimize for web and embed display
5️⃣ Associate App with Base
Edit files in your GitHub project:
Upload icon and images
Confirm site URL is correct
Update farcaster.json
Go to: 👉 https://base.dev
Log in with:
Same email used for Coinbase
Register your mini app by providing:
App URL
Required app details
Base will give you:
Payload
Security key
Association data
Paste these into: 👉 farcaster.json
This step officially links your app to your Base account.
6️⃣ Launch and Share
Post your mini app link on:
Base
Farcaster
Your app will now run inside the Base ecosystem
It can also be accessed directly via browser
💡 Clean Mental Model
Idea → Generate App → Push to GitHub → Prepare Assets → Verify on Base → Share
